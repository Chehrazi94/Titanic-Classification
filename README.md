### Titanic-Classification

Summary: In this project, several machine learning algorithms namely, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest were employed to determine whether a passenger with a set of features survives or not.

Data: The data employed in this model were obtained from a Kaggle competition on this problem. More details on the available information for each passenger (features) are discussed in the .ipynb file of the project.
